Each device requires a lot of plumbing and wiring to connect the device to the IoT solution, such as dealing with the device’s protocols and data structures. Eclipse Vorto takes a completely technology-independent approach – and this eventually makes it easier to implement standards. What are known as information models provide an abstract description of device properties and functions. These information models can then be managed and made available through the Vorto Repository. This means device manufacturers can release information models for users to download; so users can integrate their devices far more easily."

    description = "The Vorto language is developed based on other, well known programming languages like Java, but with the focus to express device functionality in a clean and slick way. It is both intuitive to understood by people and processable by machines. By leveraging this DSL you can describe the capabilities and functionality of a device as an Information Model. Information Models are assembled from re-usable, abstract and technology-agnostic Function Blocks. IoT Solutions process the Function Block specific data, to be able to stay agnostic of the actual device(s).
